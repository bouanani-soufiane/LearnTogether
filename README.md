## Project Context  

### Problem Statement  
Students at YouCode School need a centralized platform to share their problems, find collaborative solutions, and support each other in their educational journey. Currently, communication is scattered across emails, social media, and other channels, making it difficult to find relevant information and collaborate effectively.  

### Proposed Solution  
This project proposes an innovative and intuitive digital platform powered by **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **recommendation systems** to address the educational needs of students, teachers, and administrators. The platform will include features such as:  
- A Q&A system  
- AI-powered blogs
